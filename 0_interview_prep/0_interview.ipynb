    "Python was released by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Is Python an interpreted language?\n",
    "Yes, Python is an **interpreted language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.\n",
    "  * Programs written in interpreted languages are executed by an interpreter, which reads the source code line-by-line or block-by-block, translates it into machine code, and runs it immediately. This process happens every time the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Compiled Languages: Programs written in compiled languages are transformed (compiled) into machine code by a compiler before they are run. The output is a standalone executable file that can be run on its own without further translation. This compilation is done only once, and the executable can be run many times afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is executed by an interpreter line by line at runtime.\n",
    "Unlike compiled languages such as C or C++, Python does not require manual compilation before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, Python first compiles source code into bytecode and then interprets it using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",

    "### Q3. What is a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "Python is a **dynamically typed language**, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to declare variable types explicitly; Python infers the type based on the assigned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of dynamic typing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Faster development and prototyping\n",
    "- Less boilerplate code\n",
    "- Easier to learn\n",
    "- Flexible and supports polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Type-related errors occur at runtime\n",
    "- Slower performance compared to statically typed languages\n",
    "- Harder to maintain large codebases without type hints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q6. Why is Python called a high-level language?\n",
    "When we say **\"Python is a high-level language,\"** \n",
    "    we're referring to the level of abstraction between the language and the computer's hardware. \n",
    "    Means - Python's syntax is closer to human language, making it easier to read and write. We don't need to write code in that language which machine understands.\n",
    "    So, python code gets converted into machine code but we dont do it from our side, it is automatic.\n",
    "    In Low level language we would be writing code in that syntax which machine would understand. like: 0110000111000\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is called a high-level language because it abstracts low-level hardware details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its syntax is closer to human language, and Python automatically handles memory management and machine-level instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is PEP 8?\n",
    "PEP 8 stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal 8**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the official style guide that defines conventions for writing readable and consistent Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are tools that have been created to check your code against the PEP 8 guidelines, \n",
    "  and these tools can issue warnings if your code doesn't adhere to the conventions.\n",
    "  One popular tool is flake8. \n",
    "  When you run flake8 on your Python code, it checks for violations of PEP 8 guidelines and other potential programming issues, then warns you about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just in case if want to use `flake8`\n",
    "- pip install flake8\n",
    "- flake8 your_python_file.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. What is the difference between scripting and programming languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting means - to automate the certain tasks, scripting languages don't require compilation steps and they are interpreted.\n",
    "  Example: Java code needs to be compiled before running.\n",
    "  Where - Python, PHP, JS - needs no compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "  So, Programming languages are compiled whereas scripting languages are interpreted.\n",
    "  But Python can also compile its code into bite code and then interpret it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scripting languages:**\n",
    "- Interpreted\n",
    "- Used mainly for automation\n",
    "- Example: Python, JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming languages:**\n",
    "- Traditionally compiled\n",
    "- Example: C, C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Python fits both categories because it compiles code into bytecode and then interprets it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?\n",
    "\n",
    "**.py files:**\n",
    "- Contain Python source code\n",
    "- Human-readable\n",
    "- Written by developers\n",
    "\n",
    "**.pyc files:**\n",
    "- Contain compiled bytecode\n",
    "- Stored inside __pycache__\n",
    "- Created automatically when modules are imported\n",
    "- Improve performance for repeated imports\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. What are Python namespaces?\n",
    "* A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "* When you create an object, Python keeps track of its name and where it belongs in your program. This tracking is done in a way similar to a dictionary, where each name (key) is linked to its location (value). \n",
    "* So namespace is a mapping between names and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows the **LEGB rule**:\n",
    "- Local: names used inside a function.\n",
    "- Enclosing: When names defined in any outer functions. The outer function's namespace is 'enclosing'.\n",
    "- Global: objects that you create at the main program level\n",
    "- Built-in: these are all the pre-defined objects that Python provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/how-are-variables-stored-in-python-stack-or-heap/\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. What is garbage collection and reference counting?\n",
    "* Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object in Python maintains a reference count.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the reference count reaches zero, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.\n",
    "Python also uses a garbage collector to handle cyclic references.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q13. What is duck typing?\n",
    "Duck typing means that Python determines an object’s suitability based on its behavior rather than its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q14. What is the difference between a module, package, and library?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module:** A single Python file  \n",
    "**Package:** A collection of modules  \n",
    "**Library:** A collection of packages (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q15. What is the difference between range and xrange?\n",
    "- `xrange` existed in Python 2 and was memory efficient.\n",
    "- In Python 3, `range` behaves like `xrange`.\n",
    "- `xrange` does not exist in Python 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What Are Python Namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **namespace** is a naming system used to ensure that names are unique and to avoid naming conflicts in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace can be thought of as an organized storage system where every object—such as variables, functions, or classes—gets a unique name. Internally, Python manages namespaces in a structure similar to a dictionary, where:\n",
    "- the key is the object name\n",
    "- the value is the object stored in memory\n",

    "### Types of Namespaces in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has four main types of namespaces, each serving a different purpose.\n",

    "#### 1. Built-in Namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains all pre-defined names provided by Python\n",
    "- Always available in any Python program\n",
    "- Includes built-in functions and types such as `print`, `len`, `int`, and `list`\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(len(\"Python\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Global Namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains names defined at the top level of a module or script\n",
    "- Created when the module is loaded\n",
    "- Accessible throughout the module unless shadowed by local names\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10  # global variable\n",

    "\n",
    "- Exists when a function is defined inside another function\n",
    "- Names defined in the outer function belong to the enclosing namespace\n",
    "- Accessible inside the inner function\n",
