    "Yes, Python is an **interpreted language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.\n",
    "  * Programs written in interpreted languages are executed by an interpreter, which reads the source code line-by-line or block-by-block, translates it into machine code, and runs it immediately. This process happens every time the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Compiled Languages: Programs written in compiled languages are transformed (compiled) into machine code by a compiler before they are run. The output is a standalone executable file that can be run on its own without further translation. This compilation is done only once, and the executable can be run many times afterward.\n",
