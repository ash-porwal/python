    "## Q1. What is OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs is a programming approach where we create objects that contain both data and methods,\n",
    " making code more reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "- Data (attributes / variables)\n",
    "- Behavior (methods / functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves code reusability\n",
    "- Makes programs easier to understand and modify\n",
    "- Helps manage large and complex applications\n",
    "- Models real-world problems effectively\n",
    "- Enhances data security through data hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Four Main Principles of OOPs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation means binding data and methods together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Protects data from unauthorized access\n",
    "- Access is controlled using access modifiers\n",
    "- Improves security and maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (conceptual):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "            self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "        def get_name(self):\n",
    "            return self.__name\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it\n",
    "- Reduces complexity\n",
    "- Improves readability and design\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (conceptual):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Vehicle(ABC):\n",
    "        @abstractmethod\n",
    "        def start(self):\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a child class to acquire the properties and methods of a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Promotes code reusability\n",
    "- Reduces duplication\n",
    "- Establishes a parent-child relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (conceptual):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "        def sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "        def sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means one interface with multiple forms.  \n",
    "The same method name can behave differently depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Achieved through method overriding or operator overloading\n",
    "- Improves flexibility and scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (conceptual):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Bird:\n",
    "        def fly(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Bird can fly\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Penguin(Bird):\n",
    "        def fly(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Penguin cannot fly\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Q2. What is a Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects.  \n",
    "It defines:\n",
    "- Attributes (data / variables)\n",
    "- Methods (functions / behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "A class does not occupy memory until an object is created from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def greet(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** is a real-world entity created from a class.  \n",
    "It represents an actual instance that:\n",
    "- Occupies memory\n",
    "- Can access class attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple objects can be created from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    p1 = Person()\n",
    "    p1.greet()\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **instance** is a specific occurrence of a class.  \n",
    "In Python, the terms **object** and **instance** are often used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "- Class → Blueprint\n",
    "- Instance/Object → Actual implementation of that blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    p1 = Person()\n",
    "    p2 = Person()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `p1` and `p2` are two different instances of the `Person` class.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is `self`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is a reference to the **current instance of the class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why `self` is needed:\n",
    "- It allows a method to access and modify the instance’s variables\n",
    "- It differentiates instance variables from local variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points:\n",
    "- `self` is passed automatically by Python\n",
    "- You must explicitly include `self` as the first parameter in instance methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",

    "## How to Instantiate a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instantiation** means creating an object from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "    object_name = ClassName()\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "            self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    car1 = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
    "    car2 = Car(\"BMW\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `Car` is the class\n",
    "- `car1` and `car2` are instances (objects)\n",
    "- `__init__` is called automatically during instantiation\n",
